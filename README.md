# Adaptive Beamforming for Directional Signal Enhancement

## Project Overview
This project develops an **adaptive beamforming system** to enhance signal reception in a **multi-source environment**, with a focus on improving the accuracy of **direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation** and **interference suppression**. Combining **Kalman Filter** for DOA denoising and **MUSIC algorithm** for spatial spectrum estimation, the system dynamically adapts its beamforming weights to maximize signal quality.

## Background
In modern wireless communication systems, **beamforming** is a critical technology used to focus the reception or transmission of signals in desired directions while suppressing interference. Accurate estimation of signal and interference directions-of-arrival (DOA) is essential for effective beamforming. This project addresses the challenge of **DOA estimation errors** by using Kalman filtering to improve the stability and accuracy of the estimates.

## Approach
- Applied **Kalman Filter** to refine real-time DOA estimates for both desired signals and interference sources.
- Used **MUSIC algorithm** to generate spatial spectra and identify signal and interference directions.
- Designed an **adaptive beamformer** that dynamically adjusts antenna array weights based on the filtered DOA information.
- Compared the proposed beamformerâ€™s performance against the **LCMV (Linearly Constrained Minimum Variance) beamformer**, showing significant improvements in interference suppression and target signal enhancement.

## Key Features
- Real-time DOA tracking using Kalman filtering.
- High-resolution spatial spectrum estimation via MUSIC algorithm.
- Dynamic beamforming weight adaptation.
- Improved **Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SIR)** and robustness in multi-source scenarios.

## Tools & Technologies
- **MATLAB** (System simulation & algorithm implementation)
- **Kalman Filter** (DOA smoothing & prediction)
- **MUSIC Algorithm** (Spatial spectrum estimation)
- **Adaptive Beamforming** (Dynamic weight calculation)

## Results
- The adaptive beamforming system demonstrated **better interference rejection** and **higher target signal clarity** than conventional LCMV beamforming, especially under dynamic scenarios with time-varying DOAs.
