# Adaptive-Beamforming-for-Directional-Signal-Enhancement
Developed an adaptive beamforming system using Kalman filter for DOA denoising and MUSIC algorithm for spatial filtering. Achieved better SNR and interference suppression than LCMV beamformer in dynamic scenarios with fluctuating source and interference directions.
